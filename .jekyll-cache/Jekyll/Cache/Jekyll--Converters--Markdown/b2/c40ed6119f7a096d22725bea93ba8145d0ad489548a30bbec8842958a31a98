NRDC's India Initiative: Preparing for Public Health Impacts of Climate Change: Heat waves, floods, and infectious disease outbreaks are just some of the public health threats in India that could by exacerbated by climate change. Communities need the ability to assess their own climate-related public health risks and put effective adaptation measures into place. NRDC's India Initiative is working with a premier Indian health organization to develop a climate-health preparedness plan in a major Indian city, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, focused on preventing heat-related deaths and illnesses. The India Initiative is also working to assess the vulnerabilities of local communities to extreme heat events and to develop municipal strategies for preparing and responding to climate emergencies. -->
